# multiple-choice-quiz

- Goals of the code: *Create a multiple choice quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This quiz implements a count down timer, question prompts and an option to save your score to local storage

- Use: *To start the game, please press Start, and it will automatically ask you the first of five questions

- Configuration: *In order to use this webpage, please use the link provided: https://unfazedxx.github.io/multiple-choice-quiz/

- Troubleshooting: *Was not able to get the Javascript work as intended while linking the seperate index.js file. In order to work around this and still have functionality, the JS script is included in the HTML body. Index.js is still in the repository, but the information present is not accurate or working properly with the page.
